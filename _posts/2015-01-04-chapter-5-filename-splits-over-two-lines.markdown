On page 163, I mention that we should create a file called `todos.json`. This led
to an unfortunate line hyphenated line break which makes it look like the file
should be called `to-dos.json`. This can cause confusion since later I refer to it
as `todos.json`.

Thanks to Gregory Hill for reporting this!
