In Chapter 4, there's a practice problem that has you write a function
called `arrayContainsNTimes`. In Chapter 5, I refer back to that
function on page 179 and I call it `containsNTimes`.

In future printings and updates of the book, I'll just refer to the
function as `containsNTimes` (because `arrayContainsNTimes` is a
little wordy for my tastes).

Thanks to Mike Hennessey for pointing this out!
