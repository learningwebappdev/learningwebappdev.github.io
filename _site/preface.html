    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In early 2008, after about six years of grad school and teaching
    part-time, I found myself hoping to land a job as a full-time computer
    science professor. It didn't take me long to realize that professor
    jobs are really hard to come by, and obtaining a good one has almost
    as much to do with luck as it has to do with anything else. So I did
    what any self-respecting academic does when faced with a scary
    academic job market: I decided to make myself employable by learning
    how to develop web applications.</p>
    <p>This may sound a little strange. After all, I had been studying
    computer science for about nine years at that point, and had been
    teaching students how to develop software for about six years.
    Shouldn't I have <em>already known</em> how to build web applications? It
    turns out that there's a pretty large gap between practical, everyday
    software engineering and programming as taught by computer science
    departments at colleges and universities. In fact, my knowledge of web
    development was limited to HTML and a little CSS that I had taught
    myself at the time.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, I had several friends who were actively working in the
    web development world, and most of them seemed to be talking about a
    (relatively) new framework called Ruby on Rails. It seemed like a good
    place to focus my efforts. So I purchased several books on the topic
    and started reading online tutorials to get up to speed.</p>
    <p>And after a couple months of really trying to get it, I nearly gave up.</p>
    <p>Why? Because most of the books and tutorials started out with the
    assumption that I had already been developing web apps for years! And
    even though I had a pretty solid background in computer programming, I
    found all of the material extremely terse and difficult to follow. For
    example, it turns out you can take an awful lot of computer science
    classes without ever coming across the Model-View-Controller design
    pattern, and some of the books assumed you understood that in the
    first chapter!</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, I managed to learn enough about web app development to
    get a few consulting gigs to support me until I managed to land a
    professor job. And through that, I realized I enjoyed the practical
    aspects of the field so much that I continued consulting outside of
    teaching.</p>
    <p>After a few years of doing both, I was offered the opportunity to
    teach my first class in Web Application Development at the University
    of North Carolina at Asheville. My initial inclination was to <em>start</em>
    with Ruby on Rails, but when I started reading the latest books and
    tutorials, I realized that they hadn't improved much over the years.
    This isn't to say that they aren't good resources for people who
    already have a background in the basics, it's just that they didn't
    seem suitable for the students I was teaching.</p>
    <p>Sadly, but not surprisingly, the academic books on web development are
    far worse! Many of them contain outdated concepts and idioms, and
    don't cover the topics in a way that make platforms like Ruby on Rails
    more accessible. I even reviewed one book that was updated in 2011 and
    still used table-based layouts and the 'font' tag!</p>
    <p>I didn't have much of a choice but to develop my course from scratch,
    creating all the material myself. I had done a little work in some
    consulting gigs with Node.js (server-side JavaScript) at the time, so
    I thought it would be interesting to try to teach a course that
    covered the same language on the client and server. Furthermore, I
    made it my goal to give the students enough background to launch into
    the self-study of Ruby on Rails if they decided to continue.</p>
    <p>This book consists largely of the material that I created while I was
    teaching this course at UNCA. It shows how to build a basic
    database-backed web application from scratch using JavaScript. This
    includes a basic web-development workflow (using a text editor and
    version control), the basics of client-side technologies (HTML, CSS,
    jQuery, JavaScript), the basics of server-side technologies (Node.js,
    HTTP, Databases), the basics of cloud deployment (Cloud Foundry), and
    some essential good code practices (functions, MVC, DRY). Along the
    way we'll get to explore some of the fundamentals of the JavaScript
    language, how to program using arrays and objects, and the mental
    models that come along with this type of software development.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="techChoices">
    <h3>Technology Choices</h3>
    <p>For version control, I picked Git, because &mdash;well&mdash; it's Git and it's
    awesome. Plus, it gave my students the opportunity to learn to use
    GitHub, which is becoming immensely popular. Although I don't cover
    GitHub in this book, it's pretty easy to pick up once you get the hang
    of Git.</p>
    <p>I decided to use jQuery on the client because it's still relatively
    popular and I enjoy working with it. I didn't use any other frameworks
    on the client, although I do mention Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb
    Foundation in Chapter 3. I chose to stay away from modern
    client-side frameworks like Backbone or Ember, because I think they
    are confusing for people who are just starting out. Like Rails,
    however, you should be able to easily dive into them after reading
    this book.</p>
    <p>On the server-side, I chose Express because it's (relatively)
    lightweight and unopinionated. I decided against covering client- and
    server-side templating, because I think it's essential to learn to do
    things by hand first.</p>
    <p>I decided against relational databases because it seemed like I
    couldn't give a meaningful overview of the topic in the time I
    allotted to that aspect of the course. Instead, I chose MongoDB
    because it is widely used in the Node.js community and uses JavaScript
    as a query language. I also just happen to really like Redis so I
    provided coverage of that as well.</p>
    <p>I selected Cloud Foundry as the deployment platform because it was the
    only one of the three that I considered (including Heroku and
    Nodejitsu) that offered a free trial and didn't require a credit card
    to set up external services. That said, the differences between the
    platforms aren't huge, and going from one to another shouldn't be too
    hard.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="bookForYou">
    <h3>Is This Book for You?</h3>
    <p>This book is not designed to make you a "ninja" or a "rock star" or
    even a particularly good computer programmer. It won't prepare you for
    immediate employment, nor can I promise that it will show you "the
    right way" to do things.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it will give you a solid foundation in the
    essential topics that you'll need in order to understand how the
    pieces of a modern web app fit together, and it will provide a
    launching point to further study on the topic. If you work your way
    through this book, you'll know everything that I wish I had known when
    I was first starting out with Rails.</p>
    <p>You'll get the most out of this book if you have a little experience
    programming and no previous experience with web development. At
    minimum, you probably should have seen basic programming constructs
    like 'if-else' statements, loops, variables, and data types. That
    said, I won't assume that you have any experience with object-oriented
    programming, nor any particular programming language. You can obtain
    the necessary background by following tutorials on
    <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> or
    <a href="http://codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>, or by taking a programming
    course at your local community college.</p>
    <p>In addition to being used for self-study, I hope that this book can
    serve as a textbook for community classes in web application
    development, or perhaps a one-semester (14-week) college-level course.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="learningWith">
    <h3>Learning with This Book</h3>
    <p>Developing web applications is definitely a skill that you'll need to
    learn by doing. With that in mind, I've written this book to be read
    actively. What this means is that you'll get the most out of it if
    you're sitting at a computer while reading it, and if you actually
    type in all the examples.</p>
    <p>Of course, this particular approach is fraught with peril--there is a
    danger that the code examples will not work if you don't type them
    exactly as they appear. To alleviate that risk, I've created a GitHub
    repository with all of the examples in this book in working order. You
    can view them on the Web at
    <a href="http://github.com/semmypurewal/LearningWebAppDev">http://www.github.com/semmypurewal/LearningWebAppDev</a>. Because the full
    examples live there, I try to avoid redundantly including full code
    listings throughout.</p>
    <p>In addition, I leave big portions of the projects open-ended. When I
    do that, it's because I want you to try to finish them on your own. I
    encourage you to do that before looking at the full examples I've
    posted online. Every chapter concludes with a set of practice problems
    and pointers to more information, so I encourage you to complete those
    as well.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="teachingWith">
    <h3>Teaching with This Book</h3>
    <p>When I teach this material in a 14-week class, I usually spend about
    2–3 weeks on the material in the first three chapters, and 3–4 weeks
    on the material in the last three. That means I spend the majority of
    the time on the middle three chapters, which cover JavaScript
    programming, jQuery, AJAX, and Node.js. The students that I teach seem
    to struggle the most with arrays and objects, so I spend extra time on
    those because I think they are so essential to computer programming in
    general.</p>
    <p>I definitely cover things in a more 'computer-sciency' way than most
    books on this topic, so it might be a good fit for a course in
    computer science programs. Specifically, I cover mental models such as
    trees and hierarchical systems, and I try to emphasize functional
    programming approaches where they make sense (although I try not to
    draw attention to this in the narrative). If you find yourself
    teaching in a computer science program, you might choose to focus more
    clearly on these aspects of the material.</p>
    <p>I currently have no plans to post solutions to the practice problems
    (although that may change if I get a lot of requests), so you can feel
    comfortable assigning them as homework and out-of-class projects.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="forHelp">
    <h3>Where to Go for Help</h3>
    <p>As mentioned before, there is a
    <a href="http://github.com/semmypurewal/LearningWebAppDev">GitHub Repository</a> with all of the code samples contained in this book. In
    addition, you can check out <a href="http://learningwebappdev.com/errata.html"> this page</a> for errata
    and other updates as they are necessary.</p>
    <p>I also try to stay pretty accessible and would be glad to help if you
    need it. Feel free to tweet at me <a href="http://twitter.com/semmypurewal">@semmypurewal</a> with quick
    questions/comments, or email me any time <a href="mailto:me@semmy.me">me@semmy.me</a> with longer
    questions. I also encourage you to use the "issues" feature of our
    GitHub repository to ask questions. I'll do my best to respond as
    quickly as I can.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="codeComments">
    <h3>General Comments on Code</h3>
    <p>I've done my best to stay idiomatic and clear wherever possible. That
    said, those two goals are sometimes in conflict with each other.
    Therefore, there are times when I didn't do things "the right way" for
    pedagogical reasons. I hope that those places are self-evident to
    experienced developers, and that they don't cause any grief for novice
    developers in the long run.</p>
    <p>All of the code should work fine in modern web browsers, and I've
    tested everything in Chrome. Obviously, I can't guarantee things will
    work in older versions of Internet Explorer. Please let me know if you
    find any browser compatibility issues in the Internet Explorer 10+ or
    modern versions of any other browser.</p>
    <p>For the most part, I've followed idiomatic JavaScript, but there are a
    few places I've strayed. For example, I preferred double quotes
    instead of single quotes for strings, primarily because I've been
    working under the assumption that students may be coming from a
    Java/C++ background. I choose to use quotes around property names in
    object literals so that JSON doesn't look too different from
    JavaScript objects. I also use `$` as the first character in variables
    that are pointing to jQuery objects. I find that it maintains clarity
    and makes the code a little more readable for novices.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="acknowlegements">
    <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
    <p>Thanks to the nice folks in the Computer Science department at UNC
    Asheville for letting me teach this class twice. And, of course,
    thanks to the students who took the class for being patient with me as
    this material evolved.</p>
    <p>Thanks to my editor Meg Blanchette for doing her best to keep me on
    track and--of course--her constant patience with missed deadlines. I'm
    going to miss our weekly email exchanges!</p>
    <p>Thanks to Simon St. Laurent for offering lots of advice early on and
    helping me get the idea approved by O'Reilly.</p>
    <p>Sylvan Kavanaugh and Mark Philips both did a very careful reading of
    every chapter and gave lots of very helpful feedback along the way.
    Emily Watson read the first four chapters and gave lots of thoughtful
    suggestions for improvements. Mike Wilson read the last four chapters
    and gave invaluable technical advice. I owe you all a debt of
    gratitude and hope I can repay the favor one day.</p>
    <p>Bob Benites, Will Blasko, David Brown, Rebekah David, Andrea Fey, Eric
    Haughee, Bruce Hauman, John Maxwell, Susan Reiser, Ben Rosen, and Val
    Scarlata read various revisions of the material and provided helpful
    suggestions. I sincerely appreciate the time and effort they put in.
    You rock!</p>
    <p>Despite the all-around-excellence of the reviewers and friends who
    looked at the material, it's nearly impossible to write a book like
    this without some technical errors, typos, and bad practices slipping
    through the cracks. I take full responsibility for all of them.</p>
