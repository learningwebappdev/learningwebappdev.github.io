For some reason, there are a couple of places that images got mixed up in the
final pressing. One of the most glaring examples of this is on page 19. Figure
1-12 should be a picture of a Git repository with 4 commits. Instead, it's
a picture of a DOM tree.

The actual picture for Figure 1-12 is [here](/images/git_diagram.png).
